# Employee-Attrition-Prediction
In this project I have used several machine learning algorithms to classify attrition. I get 87.07% accuracy using gradient boosting algorithm.

In business, employee attrition is when employees leave the company for whatever reason, either they've found a new job or retired, and haven't been replaced immediately.
For a company to be successful, it needs not only to attract top talent but it also needs to retain these talents. For this reason, I have the job to look into a dataset containing information regarding a certain company's employee list to try to find patterns that may provide useful information in understanding why employees leave.
